MTG Deck Builder
Overview
MTG Deck Builder is a Python script that streamlines the deck-building process for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) players. It simplifies the task of selecting cards for your MTG deck by automating searches based on your commander's color identity, keywords, and card type. Whether you're a beginner looking to build your first deck or a seasoned pro in need of quick deck-building assistance, MTG Deck Builder can help you find the right cards efficiently.

Features
Commander Information: Enter your commander's name, and the script fetches color identity, mana cost, price, card text, and card type from the Scryfall API.

Automated Searches: Search for cards that match keywords found in your commander's card text. You can filter by card type, such as instant, sorcery, artifact, and more.

Staples Lists: Access predefined lists of "staples" â€“ cards that are generally considered strong and versatile in many decks.

Deck Building: Add cards to your deck as you search through the results. The script helps you manage your deck by keeping track of card counts.

Card Text Display: See card text in search results, so you know what each card does before adding it to your deck.

Easy Navigation: Continue searching for cards within the same type or go back to search for other card types.

Deck Completion: When you reach 65 cards in your deck, the script prompts you to decide whether to fill the remaining slots with lands.
